{
    "browser": true, // Expect code always to run in browser
    "esnext": true, // This option tells JSHint that your code uses ECMAScript 6 specific syntax. Note that these features are not finalized yet and not all browsers implement them.
    "eqeqeq": true, // Require triple equals (===) for comparison
    "forin": true, // This option requires all for in loops to filter object's items. The for in statement allows for looping through the names of all of the properties of an object including those inherited throught the prototype chain. This behavior can lead to unexpected items in your object so it is generally safer to always filter inherited properties out as shown in the example:
    "quotmark": "single", // This option enforces the consistency of quotation marks used throughout your code.
    "undef": true, // Require all non-global variables to be declared (prevents global leaks)
    "unused": true, // This option warns when you define and never use your variables.
    "jquery": true, // This option defines globals exposed by the jQuery JavaScript library.
    "strict": true, // This option requires all functions to run in ECMAScript 5's strict mode.
    "globals": {
        "console": true,
        "_gaq": true
    },
    "newcap": false, // This option requires you to capitalize names of constructor functions. Capitalizing functions that are intended to be used with new operator is just a convention that helps programmers to visually distinguish constructor functions from other types of functions to help spot mistakes when using this.
    "latedef": true // Require variables/functions to be defined before being used
}
